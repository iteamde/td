        <p>TrenData's Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine allows you to query your data using plain English sentences.
            Once you view the result, you can add it to the dashboard for later references.</p>
        <p>The engine also provides as-you-type real-time suggestions that help you construct your questions.</p>
